Third post mostly aimed at business owners. After [why I won't sign your NDA](http://joyouscoding.com/blog/2015/08/12/why-i-wont-sign-your-nda.html), this is a direct successor to [make my job easier: user stories](http://joyouscoding.com/blog/2015/10/06/make-my-job-easier-user-stories.html) - it's probably a good idea to read that one first, at least for the first part about the grim situation & the problem.

The idea is the same: as a business owner, making your developer's job easier means more time and energy to create value - and it's not that complicated to do.

## The (next) problem

So, let's suppose you did write [user stories](http://joyouscoding.com/blog/2015/10/06/make-my-job-easier-user-stories.html), and prioritized them, and that we reviewed them together.

It's still difficult to understand some aspects, especially around UI

* What is exactly shown to the user?
* What can he do?
* What happens then?

## Mockups

Mockups are a representation to

## User Stories and Collaboration

### Why User Stories?

The Agile movement advocated a different approach, less based on solving the user/developer communication mismatch and more on ways to cope with it. The basic assumptions are as follows:

* The bigger the functionality, the more complex it will be to describe/explain, the bigger the chance of misunderstanding
* The bigger the functionality, the longer the time it will take before it can be demonstrated (and validated)

### Template

This leads to a simple (at least in its formulation) description:

* Try to keep features as small as possible (so the areas of possible misunderstandings are the smallest possible)
* Be sure that every single feature can be observed by a non technical user

The result of this is what we call a User Story - a simple template that describe a feature in a single sentence with the following format:

> As a <em>user category</em> I want <em>given feature</em> so I can enjoy <em>benefit</em>

Some samples for a banking system:

* As a customer I want to be able to transfer money to another account so I can pay my providers
* As a customer I want to see my previous transfers to see where my money went
* As a customer I want to see an overview of all my account to get my balance in a single action

### Benefits

As the format constrains you to a single sentence, it forces you to divide your big blocks into small ones. Not an easy process, but a very valuable one as the risk of misunderstanding becomes very low - and there is more:

* The story focusses on the user - who he is, what he wants and most important why (the benefit)
* As the story is "user observable", you'll have something to see/test after each story
* The simple format allows for easy agreement about whether something is done or not
* The small size allows to get a good vibe about the project process, as stories are typically developed in a couple of days.

## Priorities

Once you have your list of stories ready, you can write them on post-its or their digital equivalent, [Trello](trello.com). You do not need all of them to start the project. With the first 5-10, you can start.

Now is the time to prioritize them, and the best way is a simple order: move the most important ones at the top, and work down.

## Ready!

With this prioritized list in hand, you can come to a development team with a clear view of what you want. We'll typically run through the list together, asking any question we could have. Barring any technical reason to reorder (I may need to develop the user Sign Up story before being able to do for example Saved Filters), we'll then start working in order - taking the one from the top of the pile first.

## Conclusion

Making my job easier is actually a good way to help me focus on what matters to you - hence delivering more value for your business.
