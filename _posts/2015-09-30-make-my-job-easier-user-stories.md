Second post mostly aimed at business owners. As the previous on about [why I won't sign your NDA](http://joyouscoding.com/blog/2015/08/12/why-i-wont-sign-your-nda.html), this is mainly a summary of experiences building various projects in the context of our upcoming MVP Labs (more on that later).

## The Grim Situation

Software development is known to be pretty much a waste - as an industry, we are known to deliver late, badly and expensively (actually: 7% late, 56% over budget for only 44% of the functionalities, according to a McKinsey study).

This is due to a lot of factors, but the part of them I want to focus on today bad customer/developer communication - and what you as a business owner can do to make my job easier.

## The problem

Basically, we come for very different worlds. We both have our own jargon, expectations and implicit truths - as every business had. It means that explaining to me what you want is a very dangerous path:

* You'll withold some information because "everyone" knows them (implicit knowledge)
* I'll misunderstood a part of the rest, due to my own (flawed) vision of your business.

## Complete Specifications

For years, we tried to solve this using more and more complete specifications - up to thousands of pages. Altough well intentioned, this did fail in a quite spectular way for various reasons:

* Even writing do not prevent you of bias
* I'll still miss some part of it (especially if it is big)
* The amount of work required to create it make the project both expensive and very late - before even starting

While relevant in highly controlled environments, this process is most probably not what you want.

## User Stories and Collaboration

### Why User Stories?

The Agile movement advocated a different approach, less based on solving the user/developer communication mismatch and more on ways to cope with it. The basic assumptions are as follow:

* The biggest the functionality, the more complex it will be to describe/explain, the biggest chances of misunderstanding
* The biggest the functionality, the longer the time needed before it can be demonstrated (and validated)

### Template

This lead to a simple (at least in its formulation) description:

* Try to keep features as small as possible (so the areas of possible misunderstandings are the smallest possible)
* Be sure that every single feature can be observed by a non technical user

The result of this is what we call a User Story - a simple template that describe a feature in a single sentence with the following format:

> As a <em>user category</em> I want <em>given feature</em> so I can enjoy <em>benefit</em>

Some samples for a banking system:

* As a customer I want to be able to transfer money to another account so I can pay my providers
* As a customer I want to see my previous transfers to see where my money went
* As a customer I want to see an overview of all my account to get my balance in a single action

### Benefits

As the format constrains you to a single sentence, it forces you to divide your big blocks into small ones. Not an easy process, but a very valuable one as the risk of misunderstanding becomes very low - and there is more:

* The story focus on the user - who he is, what he wants and most important why (the benefit)
* As the story is "user observable", you'll have something to see/test after each story (so very often)
* The simple format allows for easy agreement about whether something is done or not
* The small size allows to get a good vibe about the project process, as stories are typicall developed in a couple of days.

## Priorities

Once you have your list of stories ready (at least the first 5-10, you don't need to do them for the whole project to get started), you can put them on postits or their digital equivalent, [Trello](trello.com).

Now is the time to prioritize them, and the best way is a simple order: put the most important one on top, and work down.

## Ready!

With this prioritized list in hand, you can come to a development team with a clear view of what you want. We'll typically run through the list together, asking any question we could have. Barring any technical reason to reorder (I may need to develop the user Sign Up story before being able to do for example Saved Filters), we'll then start working in order - taking the one from the top of the pile first.

Making my job easier is actually a good way to help me focus on what matters to you - hence delivering more value for your business.
